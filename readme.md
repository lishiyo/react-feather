# react-feather v0.0.1

_by [eric hu](http://erichu.tumblr.com)_

These is an adaptation of Eric Hu's fantastic theme, Feather, to be a [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) site. 

## Installation

1. Fork.
1. Edit `feather.html:50-58`. Replace "mrkev" with your github username.

## Disclaimer

This is an alpha version of an experimental project. Don't run any critical blogs on this. Make sure to fork, because I might edit the files here, and since the theme uses raw files from github, it might break your site if you don't.
